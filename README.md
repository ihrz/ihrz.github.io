## Important Notice: Transition to GitLab

Hello everyone,

We wanted to inform you that, as part of an effort to better manage our open-source projects, we have decided to transition the **iHorizon Project** and all its related repositories to **GitLab**. While our repositories will remain accessible on GitHub for the time being, **all future development** and updates will be hosted on GitLab moving forward.

### Why the move?
This transition is aimed at improving collaboration, offering better integration features, and leveraging GitLab's unique tools for continuous integration and deployment, which will help streamline our open-source projects.

### What does this mean for you?
- **Current repositories on GitHub**: They will remain available, but no further updates will be made here.
- **New repositories and future development**: All future development will be managed and updated on GitLab.
- **Important**: If you are using any of our GitHub repositories, we encourage you to start following the project on GitLab for the latest updates and contributions.

### How to follow us on GitLab
You can find our GitLab organization at the following link:

### Thank you for your support!
We deeply appreciate the support and contributions we've received on GitHub, and we hope to continue this journey with you on GitLab. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.

Stay tuned for more updates!

**Best regards,**
